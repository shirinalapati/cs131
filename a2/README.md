# `remindme.sh` - A Reminder Shell Script

## What this command does
The `remindme.sh` command allows users to set a reminder for a specific time. The script waits until the specified time and then displays a reminder message in the terminal.

## Why/When this command is useful
This command is useful when you want to be reminded of a task or event at a specific time but don't want to rely on external applications or GUI-based notifications. It is simple and works entirely within the terminal.

## How you can use this command
To use the command, run the script with two arguments: a reminder message and the time for the reminder. The time must be in the `HH:MM` format using the 24-hour clock.

### Syntax:
```bash
./remindme.sh "Your reminder message" HH:MM
